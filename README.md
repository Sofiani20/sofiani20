## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a Financial and Actuary Engineer by training (graduated in June 2022), with skills in Data Science. 

I am a Data Science lover.

Throughout my engineering training, I acquired a deep foundation in Statistics & Probability, knowledge of Financial Markets and Risk Management Techniques as well as Life and Non-Life Actuarial science.

I discovered Data Science since 2020 and I fell in love with this profession. Since then I never tire of developing my data skills. With passion, perseverance and the help of ALLAH, I will be an excellent Data Scientist.
